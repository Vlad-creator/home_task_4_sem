The class template basic_string stores and manipulates sequences of char-like objects, which are non-array objects of trivial standard-layout type. The class is dependent neither on the character type nor on the nature of operations on that type. The definitions of the operations are supplied via the Traits template parameter - a specialization of std::char_traits or a compatible traits class. Traits::char_type and CharT must name the same type; otherwise the program is ill-formed.
